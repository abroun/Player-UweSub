Building
--------

The example can be built by making a directory (anywhere on your system where
you have write permissions will do), changing to that directory and executing
CMake with the example's source directory as an argument. For example, if you
have installed Player into /usr/local, you could do the following:

$ cd ~
$ mkdir exampleinterface
$ cd exampleinterface
$ ccmake /usr/local/share/player/examples/plugins/exampleinterface/

Use the configure option (press 'c' in the Linux ncurses-based UI, for example)
until the generate option becomes available, then use that (press 'g' in the
ncurses UI). Then use the standard method of compiling for your environment to
compile (on Linux, this will probably be GNU Makefiles, so type 'make').

Running
-------

This example creates three objects: an interface plugin, a driver plugin for
the new interface, and a client program that uses the new interface in
conjunction with the plugin driver.

The interface plugin and driver plugin are loaded by the example.cfg
configuration file. Copy this to the directory where you built the example and
execute Player:

$ player example.cfg

In a separate terminal, execute the client program:

$ ./example_client

You should see commands, data and requests moving between the client and the
driver.
